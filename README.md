## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Use Template:** Click 'Use this template' button above to create your repository
2. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git && cd YOUR_REPO`
3. **Setup:** `make setup` (Configures environment and installs dependencies)
4. **Run:** `make run`
5. **Test:** `make test`

## 📋 Post-Template Checklist

After creating your repository from this template, complete these steps:

- [ ] Replace `[Project Name]` with your actual project name in this README
- [ ] Update `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO` placeholders throughout this file
- [ ] Modify the LICENSE file if not using MIT license
- [ ] Add language-specific files (requirements.txt, package.json, go.mod, pom.xml, etc.)
- [ ] Update Makefile targets with your actual build/test commands
- [ ] Configure Dockerfile for your specific runtime and dependencies
- [ ] Define your core application logic in `src/`
- [ ] Write tests in `tests/` directory
- [ ] Update INTERVIEW_NOTES.md with your architectural decisions
- [ ] Configure CI/CD workflow for your specific linting and testing tools
- [ ] Add actual code coverage and linting badges once CI is running

## Why This Template?

This template is designed with professional software engineering and interview preparation in mind:

### Architectural Choices

- **Docker Support**: Ensures "works on my machine" is never an excuse. Containerization demonstrates understanding of deployment consistency and modern DevOps practices
- **Makefile Automation**: Provides a language-agnostic interface for common operations (build, test, run). Shows you understand build automation and developer experience
- **Structured Folders**: Clear separation between source (`src/`) and tests (`tests/`) follows industry-standard practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates familiarity with automated testing and continuous integration
- **Interview Documentation**: `INTERVIEW_NOTES.md` helps you articulate technical decisions during interviews

### Professional Polish

- **GitHub Actions Badges**: Immediately shows build status and project health
- **Clear Documentation**: Professional READMEs signal that you can hand off projects effectively
- **Copilot Integration**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` shows you leverage AI tools strategically, not blindly

## 📖 Usage Flow

```
1. Click "Use this template" → Creates your repository
2. Clone locally → Get the code on your machine
3. Run `make setup` → Install dependencies and configure environment
4. Develop in src/ → Write your application logic
5. Write tests/ → Add test coverage
6. Run `make test` → Validate your changes
7. Git commit & push → Triggers CI/CD pipeline
8. Review Actions → See automated tests pass
```

## Usage

The project includes a standardized Makefile with common targets:

```bash
make help     # Show all available commands
make setup    # Install dependencies and configure environment
make run      # Run the application
make test     # Run tests
make lint     # Run code linter
make build    # Build the project
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

Customize these targets in the Makefile based on your specific technology stack.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This is a language-agnostic template. Add badges for your specific stack:

-->

**Current Setup:**
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Make for build automation
- Generic structure supporting any language

## Notes

- This is a generic template. Add language-specific configuration as needed.
- The CI/CD workflow will automatically run tests if a Makefile is present.
- Review and update INTERVIEW_NOTES.md as you make architectural decisions.
- Document major architectural decisions in docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md using the ADR format.
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to keep production images small.
- Run `make help` to see all available commands.
